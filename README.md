## dockerfiles

[![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/jfrazelle/dockerfiles.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/jfrazelle/dockerfiles)

This is a repo to hold various Dockerfiles for images I create.

I try to make sure each has a command at the top for running it,
if a file you are looking at does not have a command, please
pull request it!

Almost all of these live on dockerhub under [jess](https://hub.docker.com/u/jess/).

You may also want to checkout my [dotfiles](https://github.com/jfrazelle/dotfiles), specifically the aliases for all these files which are here: [github.com/jfrazelle/dotfiles/blob/master/.dockerfunc](https://github.com/jfrazelle/dotfiles/blob/master/.dockerfunc).
