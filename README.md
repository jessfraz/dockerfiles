## dockerfiles

[![Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/jessfraz/dockerfiles.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jessfraz/dockerfiles)

This is a repo to hold various Dockerfiles for images I create.

I try to make sure each has a command at the top for running it,
if a file you are looking at does not have a command, please
pull request it!

Almost all of these live on dockerhub under [jess](https://hub.docker.com/u/jess/).
Because you cannot use notary with autobuilds on dockerhub I also build these
continuously on a private registry at [r.j3ss.co](https://r.j3ss.co/) for public download. (You're
welcome.)

You may also want to checkout my [dotfiles](https://github.com/jessfraz/dotfiles), specifically the aliases for all these files which are here: [github.com/jessfraz/dotfiles/blob/master/.dockerfunc](https://github.com/jessfraz/dotfiles/blob/master/.dockerfunc).

## Dear Jess,

This is probably the least conventional way to reach out to a person, but I figured since you are such a busy person and 
a rockstar in the docker community, this was my best approach to get your attention.  I wanted to see if you would ever 
have the time to do a small impromptu meetup/discussion with our community.  

I am the "community outreach" committee chairman for a cryptocurrency called Turtle Coin. Our approach is to build a community based coin from the ground up with no promises, no premine and no ICO which has become the latest trend in crypto.  

We currently have 36 active volunteer developers on the project that all bring unique talents to our team.  A few of them are very talented docker guru's but I suggested with your vast knowledge of docker, maybe given the time you could suggest some helpful and time saving approaches on how we could leverage docker to simplify our project.  

One of our main focuses is lowering the barrier for new inexperienced members of the community to learn about decentralized networks and crypto in general and we believe that docker would be a very sound approach to incorporate into the project. We currently have just under 11,000 discord members who would be absolutely thrilled to have you join us in a discussion regarding adapting more of our platform to docker.

We mainly operate in our discord server which is the preferred method to contact the development team which can be found at http://chat.turtlecoin.lol though if you are interested we also have a very active github as well at https://github.com/turtlecoin/meta  @RocksteadyTC is one of the original founders and would be the person to chat with.

I appreciate your time and have a great day!

P.S. once again, I apologize for the PR.
