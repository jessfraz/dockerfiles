# Dockerfiles üê≥

This is a repo to hold various Dockerfiles for images I create.

[![Travis CI](https://img.shields.io/travis/jessfraz/dockerfiles.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://travis-ci.org/jessfraz/dockerfiles)

Almost all of these live on dockerhub under [jess](https://hub.docker.com/u/jess/).

Because you cannot use notary with autobuilds on dockerhub I also build these continuously on a private registry at [r.j3ss.co](https://r.j3ss.co/) for public download. (You're welcome.)

## Contributing

I try to make sure each Dockerfile has a command at the top to document running it,
if a file you are looking at does not have a command, please
pull request it!
