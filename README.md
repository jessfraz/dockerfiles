## In a nutshell

This is a fork of [jessfraz/dockerfiles](https://github.com/jessfraz/dockerfiles),
topped up with some Dockerfiles for spinning development environments.

## In a nutbasket

I use mostly tmux&vim instead of IDE, you may also want to checkout [jessfraz/dotfiles](https://github.com/jessfraz/dotfiles)
which I personally am using

The sections below describe only Dockerfiles which are not part of the upstream [jessfraz/dockerfiles](https://github.com/jessfraz/dockerfiles).
