## dockerfiles

This is a repo to hold various Dockerfiles for images I create.

I try to make sure each has a command at the top for running it, 
if a file you are looking at does not have a command, please
pull request it!

Almost all of these live on dockerhub under [jess](https://registry.hub.docker.com/repos/jess/).
