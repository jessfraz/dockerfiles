# USAGE:
#	# Build sublime-text 3 image
#	docker build -t sublime-text:3 .
#
#	# Run the container and mount the local settings and your code
#   # Your code must be under $HOME/Documents, you only need to change it here.
#		docker run -d -it \
#			-w $HOME/Documents \
#			-v $HOME/.config/sublime-text-3:$HOME/.config/sublime-text-3 \
#			-v $HOME/Documents:$HOME/Documents \
#			-v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
#			-v $HOME/.local/share/recently-used.xbel:$HOME/.local/share/recently-used.xbel \
#			-e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY \
#			-e NEWUSER=$USER \
#			-e LANG=en_US.UTF-8 \
#			sublime-text:3
#
# POSSIBLE ISSUES:
#	# 'Gtk: cannot open display: :0'

# In order to prevent writing as root:root in Sublime, we have to run the Sublime Text container
# as the user that creates the container. Normally we do this by passing $UID.
# But just passing $UID along isn't enough - Sublime has to be started by a user that exists.
# By default in the container, the only user that actually exists is root.
# Therefore we have to create a new user, and start Sublime as that user.
# This is not possible at build time, so the /run.sh script accepts an environment
# variable called $NEWUSER that creates a user and group named $USER.
# Additional note: Sublime puts a lot of stuff in ~/.config, which is mounted at runtime. Without this directory being mounted, settings/packages/etc won't persist.
