" A sensible vimrc for Go development
"
" Please note that the following settings are some default that was used by 
" myself for years. However it might be not the case for you (and your
" environment). I highly encourage to change/adapt the vimrc to your own
" needs. Think of a vimrc as a garden that needs to be maintained and fostered
" throughout years. Keep it clean and useful - Fatih Arslan
